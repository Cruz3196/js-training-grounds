1. If you're just making a small spelling, grammatical, formatting, or syntax fix, you can open an issue or a pull request.
2. If you want to add a section to a tutorial, or propose an outline for a tutorial, create an issue first.
3. We're only accepting pull requests for tutorial content. We're not accepting pull requests for any other work on the website. If you see something wrong with the site, just create an issue and we'll fix it.
4. If you have a feature request, a request for a tutorial topic, or other types of feedback, post a comment in one of our discussion threads or create a new discussion.
