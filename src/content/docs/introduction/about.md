**JS Training Grounds** is a new project from the Simple Dev team. It's a brand new set of tutorials focused on intermediate JS topics like React, Vue 3, Svelte 5, Angular, and more. Since the tutorials are focused on intermediate topics, we assume you have a basic understanding of VS Code, HTML, CSS, JS, Git, GitHub, and npm.

The tutorials are:

- Open source
- Text-based
- Up-to-date

They are also designed to allow you to code along in your own editor or online using Stackblitz.

We envision this project being broken up into different phases.

## Phase 1: Build a better quickstart

In order to make sure this project is a success, we want to make sure the scope of the project is clearly defined.

For this first phase, the focus is going to be building a better quickstart for React, Vue 3, Svelte 5, and Angular. This means focusing on teaching the basic syntax and concepts in an organized manner. It also means sticking to simple examples, like Hello World, a counter, a todo list, etc. (more complex projects will likely be part of Phase 2). After finishing the quickstarts for these topics, we'll move on to creating quickstarts for TypeScript, Next.js, and Tailwind (other topics may be added later).

When you're looking at the documentation for these projects, it can be hard to know where to start. Usually they provide multiple ways to get started, which can be confusing. Ultimately, we want JS Training Grounds to be the fastest and easiest way to get started with these technologies. We also want it to be easy to contribute to, so we've created quickstarts on how to write Markdown and how to fork the project. You can find them in the Contributing section.

## Future Phases

In the future, we hope to work more on documenting style guides/best practices for these technologies, as well as creating more realistic project-based tutorials.
