Thanks for checking out JS Training Grounds! Here are some of the ways you can help the project succeed.

## Star repo

The easiest thing you can do is star the project on <a href="https://github.com/simpledevio/js-training-grounds" target="_blank">our GitHub repo</a>. Let's try to get to 100 stars!

## Share with your networks

The next thing you can do is share the site online or with people you know in real life! You can also share <a href="https://github.com/simpledevio/js-training-grounds" target="_blank">our GitHub repo</a> if you know people interested in open source or contributing to the site.

## Become a contributor

The next thing you can do is become a contributor to the site! At a minimum, this could mean participating in the <a href="https://github.com/simpledevio/js-training-grounds/discussions" target="_blank">Discussions in our GitHub repo</a>, or creating Issues. If you want to be even more active, it could mean creating Issues, volunteering to take on Issues, and creating content for the site.

If you do want to take on Issues and contribute content to the site, you should read through our [About](/about/) page and also go through our [Contributing Guide Quickstart](/contributing-guide/). The Contributing Guide Quickstart will teach you how to use the Expressive Code syntax, which is the plugin we use to add advanced syntax highlighting features to our code snippets. It also goes over how to fork the project repo and clone it for local development.

If you want to contribute content, you should be also be familiar with VS Code and Markdown already. Also, you should be familiar with the topic that you're contributing to (React, TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind, etc.).
