This tutorial assumes you're already familiar with HTML, CSS, JS, and npm. It also assumes you know what a JS framework is for.

## Setup

First, visit the [React training ground repo](https://github.com/simpledevio/react-training-ground). Press the green **Code** button and click **Download ZIP**. Unzip the file and then open it in your editor. Then, run this command in the terminal to install the packages listed in `package.json`.

```bash
npm install
```

Then run this command to start the dev server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:5173/ in your browser. The web page should say **Hello World**.

In your editor, you'll see several files. However, for now you'll mainly be working in `App.jsx`.

### Stackblitz

If you prefer to work online, you can also open the [React training ground repo on Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/simpledevio/react-training-ground?file=src/App.jsx) and start coding right away in your browser. You don't have to run any of the npm commands if you use Stackblitz.
