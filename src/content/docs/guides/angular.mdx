This tutorial assumes you're already familiar with HTML, CSS, JS, and npm. It also assumes you know what a JS framework is for.

## Setup

First, visit the <a href="https://github.com/simpledevio/angular-training-ground" target="_blank">Angular training ground repo</a>. Press the green **Code** button and click **Download ZIP**. Unzip the file and then open it in your editor. Then, run this command in the terminal to install the packages listed in `package.json`.

```bash
npm install
```

Then run this command to start the dev server.

```bash
npm start
```

You should see something like this in your terminal.

```bash
Watch mode enabled. Watching for file changes...
NOTE: Raw file sizes do not reflect development server per-request transformations.
 ➜ Local: http://localhost:4200/
 ➜ press h + enter to show help
```

Visit <a href="http://localhost:4200/" target="_blank">localhost:4200</a> in your browser. The web page should say **Hello World**.

In your editor, you'll see several files. However, for now you'll mainly be working in `app.html`.

### Stackblitz

If you prefer to work online, you can also open the <a href="https://stackblitz.com/github/simpledevio/angular-training-ground?file=src/app/app.html" target="_blank">Angular training ground repo on Stackblitz</a> and start coding right away in your browser. You don't have to run any of the npm commands if you use Stackblitz.
