import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## How it works

<CardGrid stagger>

		Visit the guide for the topic you want to learn.
	</Card>

	<Card title="Download repo" icon="download">
		Visit the link for the right training ground repo. Download it, unzip it, and open it in your code editor.
	</Card>

	<Card title="Run commands" icon="laptop">
		Run the commands to set up your project. (Usually you just run npm install, npm run dev, and then open the web page in your web browser.)
	</Card>

	<Card title="Start learning!" icon="rocket">
		Now you can start following along with the tutorials in your own editor!
	</Card>
