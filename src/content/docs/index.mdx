import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## How it works

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="1. Open the quickstart" icon="open-book">
		Visit the quickstart for the topic you want to learn. We have quickstarts for React, Vue 3, Svelte 5, Angular, and more.
	</Card>

	<Card title="2. Download repo" icon="download">
		Visit the link for the right training ground repo. Download it, unzip it, and open it in your code editor. (Some tutorials also have a link to a Stackblitz project, which you can open in your web browser and edit online.)
	</Card>

	<Card title="3. Run commands" icon="laptop">
		Run the commands to set up your project. (Usually you just run `npm install`, `npm run dev`, and then open the web page in your web browser.)
	</Card>

	<Card title="4. Start learning!" icon="rocket">
		Now you can start following along with the tutorials in your own editor!
	</Card>
